Being relativly new to programming, as well as 100% self taught! My work might be a little basic and redondante some times
If you decide to help explain any changes you make; why the changes? and how is it better?... so I might learn, ty. 
(ps: please explain in ways a baby could understant... Comments such as "this or that already existe!!!" does not help!)
