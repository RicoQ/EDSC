# EDSC
Ethernet Data Security Center

Being relativly new to programming, as well as 100% self taught! My work might be a little basic and redondante some times
If you decide to help explain any changes you make; why the changes? and how is it better?... so I might learn, ty. 
(ps: please explain in ways a baby could understant... Comments such as "this or that already existe!!!" does not help!)

To work you need to have the following python modules installed:

     1. python-scapy
     2. python-nmap
     3. python-netifaces
